Cool! Feel free to submit a pull request with any  questions, making sure you follow the guidelines in [questions/README.md](https://github.com/theProgrammerJack/ChemistryTrivia/blob/master/questions/README.md). For new features the only rule is don't break any other features. If you want suggestions for a feature to write, we don't yet have:
* Score sharing
* Timed quiz mode
* Quizing on specific catgories

Also feel free to open issues if you find any bugs or would like my opinion on a feature idea.
